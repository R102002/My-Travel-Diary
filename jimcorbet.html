    <h1>Jim Corbet Uttarakhand , India</h1>
    <p>Jim Corbett National Park is a forested wildlife sanctuary in northern India’s Uttarakhand State. <br>
         Rich in flora and fauna, it’s known for its Bengal tigers. Animals, including tigers, leopards and wild elephants, roam the Dhikala zone. On the banks of the Ramganga Reservoir, the Sonanadi zone is home to elephants and leopards, along with hundreds of species of birds.</p>
    <p>Established in 1936, this is India's first national park. It is named after the legendary naturalist and conservationist Jim Corbett.  Located at the Himalayas' foothills, near the popular hill-station of Nainital, the beautiful Jim Corbett National Park, is famous for being home to a large number of tigers, the highest among any Indian national park. Spread over 1318.54 sq km, of which 520 sq km is the main area, and the remaining is buffer; the park is spread over the picturesque landscapes of Pauri Garhwal, Almora, and Nainital. The jeep safari into the dense forest to see the wild animals in their natural habitat is a must-have experience. And if you are lucky, then you may get a chance to even spot a tiger. While on the jeep safari, enjoy the lush green forest's views cut across by streams and rivers and a few waterfalls. There are accommodations available inside the park for night-stay as well, which offer you once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>
